#### About Me
-  I'm currently persuing a PhD on AI-enhanced Sound Event Localization and Detection for BioAcoustics.
-  Iâ€™ve graduated in a Master of Science in Music and Acoustic Engineering @ [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) with a thesis on a Deep Learning-based Method for Multi-Zone Sound Field Synthesis
<!-- -  Iâ€™m currently learning C++, TouchDesigner, Max/Msp, VR Development and fundamentals about 5G technology-->
-  Iâ€™m open to collaborate on creative projects
-  If you need help, you can ask me about DSP algorithms and  Music Information Retrieval techniques
-  How to reach me: r.alessandri@outlook.com
-  Pronouns: He/Him
-  Fun fact: I'm a DJ, an Electronic Music Producer in one hand and Audio Developer, AI/ML/DL enthusiastic on the other hand, but still haven't found a way to merge my artistic side with my engineer side

Former Intern as Audio Signal Processing & AI for Audio Researcher @ [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/) (worked on a Low-Complexity Deep learning-based method for RealTime Noise Suppression and Speech Enhancement)
